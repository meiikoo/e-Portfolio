## 📄 Introduction

Hello! I'm a senior Computer Science major at the University of Pittsburgh with a minor in Korean and a strong passion for software engineering. Over the course of my academic journey, I've built a solid foundation in Java and C through core courses like data structures, algorithms, and operating systems. I’ve also explored additional languages and technologies including Python, HTML, Haskell, and Java-based frameworks like Spring Boot.
One of my most formative experiences was working as a software engineering intern at Piesat, where I contributed to a back-end team developing a large-scale marine environment prediction system. Initially, the complexity of the project felt overwhelming, but by actively asking questions and learning from my team lead, I gained insight into how massive systems are structured and maintained. That challenge pushed me to grow and deepened my motivation to find my place in the software engineering field.
Beyond academics, I’ve continued to expand my skill set through self-study and hands-on projects. I bring to the table a strong sense of curiosity, creativity, and a constant drive to learn. My goal is to contribute to innovative, real-world solutions and continue growing as part of a collaborative and forward-thinking team.
